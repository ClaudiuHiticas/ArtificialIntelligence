Theory of possibility (fuzzy)

KB (knowledge base): info of the domain
- logic based on ranges
- store all info
IE (inference engine)
- brain
- explore the KB by reasoning for obtaining solutions / conclusions

1. define inputs/ outputs (fuzzification)
	- membership functions for each input data
	- transform each raw input data into a linguistic data
2. construct a base of rules (decision matrix) -IE
3. evaluate the rules (fuzzy inference) -IE
	1. EVALUATION OF CAUSES = For each premise of a rule (if s is (in) A) establish the membership degree of raw
input data to all fuzzy sets
	 => degree of satisfaction

	SUGENO MODEL - consequence of rule: output variable is a crisp function that depends on inputs
	- if x is in A and y is in B then z is f(x,y)

	2. EVALUATION OF CONSEQUENCES

4. aggregate the results -IE
	- consider the membership functions for all the consequences and combine
them into a single fuzzy set (a single result)

Aggregation process has as:
 Inputs: membership functions (clipped or scaled) of the consequences
 Outputs: a fuzzy set of the output variable

Sugeno model -> COA becomes a weighted average of m crisp
values obtained by applying all m rules

5. defuzzificate the result
= transform the fuzzy result into a crisp (raw) value

6. interpret the result

 
 defuzzyficate = 50 = 50 * (1 - 0) + (50 * 0) 
 defuzzyficate = 50 = 50 * (1 - 0) + (50 * 0) 
 defuzzyficate = 0 = 50 * (1 - 1) + (50 * 0) 
 defuzzyficate = 100.0 = 50 * (1 - 0) + (50 * 1.0) 
 defuzzyficate = 50 = 50 * (1 - 0) + (50 * 0) 
 defuzzyficate = 50 = 50 * (1 - 0) + (50 * 0)
